		<p>Wonder Woman burst into "Man's World" from her Amazonian homeland of Paradise Island in December 1941. She is known as Princess Diana of Themyscira in her homeland and, after arriving in America, uses the secret identity of Diana Prince. From the first recounting of her deeds in <em>All Star Comics #8</em>, Wonder Woman has fought for justice, peace, love, and gender equality and has always been a feminist icon. She initially fought the Axis powers during World War II and then moved on to oppose a series of supervillains. In her battles, she can call upon an arsenal of specialized weapons including her bulletproof bracelets that can deflect weapon fire and energy blasts, the Lasso of Truth (or Lariat of Hestia) that compels any who touch it to tell the absolute truth, and her tiara that has razor-sharp edges and can be thrown like a boomerang. She also pilots an invisible plane that can be controlled through her tiara.</p>
